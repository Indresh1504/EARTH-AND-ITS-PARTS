                    <p>Earth's crust is about 31 kilometers deep on average on land. At the bottom of the ocean, the crust is thinner and extends about 5 kilometers from the sea floor to the top of the mantle.</p>

                    <p>
                        Earth's mantle is a layer of silicate rock between the crust and the outer core. It has a mass of 4.01 Ã— 10 kg and thus makes up 67% of the mass of Earth. It has a thickness of 2,900 kilometers (1,800 mi) making up about 84% of Earth's volume.

                            Earth's inner core is the innermost geologic layer of planet Earth. It is primarily a solid ball with a radius of about 1,220 km, which is about 20% of Earth's radius or 70% of the Moon's radius
